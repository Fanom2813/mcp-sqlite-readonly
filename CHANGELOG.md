  - SQL comment stripping (removes `/* */` and `--` comments)
  - Multi-statement query validation
  - Dangerous command blocking (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, ALTER, ATTACH, DETACH, PRAGMA, REINDEX, VACUUM, ANALYZE)
  - Word boundary detection to prevent false positives
- **SQL injection prevention**:
  - Table name validation (alphanumeric and underscores only)
  - Column name validation (alphanumeric and underscores only)
  - LIMIT/OFFSET parameter validation (non-negative integers only)
  - Parameterized query support maintained
- **Comprehensive security documentation** in code comments
